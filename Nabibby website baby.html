                What are they?
            </h2>

            <p>
                Babies are newborns and young children who are in the earliest stage of human development,
                typically from birth to around 2 years old. At this stage, babies are highly dependent on
                caregivers for all their needs, including nourishment, comfort, and safety. They communicate
                primarily through crying, facial expressions, and body movements to signal their needs.
                Physically, babies are growing rapidly, with their muscles, bones, and organs developing
                in the first few months and years. They begin to gain control over basic motor skills, such
                as lifting their heads, rolling over, and eventually crawling and walking. Babies are also.
                learning about the world around them through their senses—sight, hearing, touch, taste, and
                smell—making early interactions, such as talking and playing, crucial for their cognitive
                and emotional development. During this time, babies form strong attachments with caregivers,
                relying on their love and attention for security and trust.

            <h2>How to take care of them?</h2>
            <p>
                Taking care of a newborn baby involves meeting their basic needs
                with gentle care and attentiveness. Ensure they are fed every 2-3 hours,
                either by breastfeeding or formula, and always burp them afterward
                to prevent gas. Keep their diaper area clean by changing diapers
                frequently and using a mild wipe or warm water. Maintain a comfortable
                room temperature and dress them in soft, breathable clothing. Support
                their head and neck when holding them, as their muscles are still developing.
                Establish a soothing bedtime routine to encourage healthy sleep patterns,
                and always place them on their back to sleep to reduce the risk of Sudden
                Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).
